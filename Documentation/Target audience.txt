Most people in the age of 13-35 

The target audience of our RentIt Radio system is primarily users in the age 13-35. Since our system is not just a place to listen to music, but also a place to discuss music, we think this might make older users choose ordinary radiostations. Younger people are more used to social networks and we designed our radio system to be a social network combined with radio.
