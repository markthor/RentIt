\subsection{Functional requirements}
The functional requirements describe the required functionality of the system and defines enumerations for reference.
\\ \\
\textbf{R0:}
The system shall allow all users to create a channel, add attributes and edit it.

\textbf{Domain concepts:}
The channel shall have its own collection of tracks that it plays and it is created and maintained by the channel host(the creator of the channel).\\*
The channel shall have genres, a description and comments posted by users.\\*
The channel must be visible to other users with prober search parameters.

\textbf{Dependencies:}
The requirement is nessecary for upload track and listen to channel because a track is associated with a channel.

\textbf{Priority:}
It is of essential importance, as the requirements depending on it is.
\\ \\

\textbf{R1:}
The system must allow users to listen to online radio-channel that streams audio. \\*
\textbf{Domain concepts:}
A channel has a collection of tracks that can be listened to. \\*
\textbf{Priority:}
Highest as this is the primary service that the system provides. \\*
\textbf{Implementation notes:}
The system must be able to stream audio in a smooth and clutter-free manner.
A radio-channel must be able to stream an endless stream of audio without pauses between audio tracks.
The streaming must be implemented as a webservice(Windows Communication Foundation) and it must be
easy to write a new clients for the service.
The interface for listening to audio must be as user friendly as possible.
\\ \\

\textbf{Dependencies:}
The listen to channel requirement are depended on this requirement because the track to be played is determined by the rating.\\*
\textbf{Priority:}
It is of essential importance, as the requirements depending on it is.
 \\ \\

\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
The non-functional requirements describes how the functionality shall work in multiple aspects, as well as defining success criteria for them. They are structured with FURPS+. \\

\textbf{Functionality} \\*
\textit{Channels} \\*
Channel owners must be able to assign genre tags to the channels they control/own. \\*
Two users listening to the same channel at the same time must hear the same song with same amount of elapsed time (+- 1s), in other words, a channel is "playing" the same for all listeners. \\*
A function for searching for channels must be implemented. \\*
A list of the most popular channels should be available to all users. Popularity must be based on an algorithm and it must be explained in the documentation. \\*

\textit{Tracks} \\*
The service must support tracks in .mp3 format. \\*

\textit{Logging and Error Handling} \\*
All exceptional states must be logged.\\*
All state changes must be logged.\\*

\textit{Security} \\*
All usage requires authentication. (usage meaning the use of any services related to the program)\\*

\textbf{Usability} \\*
The website should be intuitive to use for 90\% of persons above the age of 12 with regard to the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item listening to a channel
\item maintaining one. 
\item uploading songs
\item voting
\item subscribing
\end{itemize}

There must be help available for all functions in the form of text. This help must be accessible from within the client \\*
