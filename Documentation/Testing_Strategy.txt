Validation: 
	All public methods handle their own parameter validation.
	We do not test argument combinations for methods.
	We only test method behaviour.


All test method will follow the following naming convention:

	<name of class this method tests>_<name of method this unit is testing>_BehaviorTest_<the behavior this method is testing>	

example:

	public void MergeAlgorithm_Merge_BehaviorTest_RemoveTextFromMiddle()
        {
            MergeAlgorithm m = new MergeAlgorithm();
            String[] original = new String[] { "Orig", "ina", "l Text" };
            String[] latest = new String[] { "Orig", "l Text" };

            String[] merged = m.Merge(original, latest);

            Assert.AreEqual(latest.Length, merged.Length);
            for (int i = 0; i < merged.Length; i++)
            {
                Assert.AreEqual(latest[i], merged[i]);
            }
            // This is good
        }
