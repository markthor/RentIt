Data storage

For storing information about our users, channels etc. we chose Microsoft SQL Server, a database management system (DBMS) developed by Microsoft. The reason for choosing a DMBS to store most of our data in is because it is fast and optimized for storing and retrieving data. However a research paper[reference] suggests that when it comes to object with size beyond 1MB it is faster to store the object on the file system. Due to the knowledge acquired from the paper we chose to store our music files on the file system, because the average size of an mp3 file is around 3-4MB. We have a table called track which have a path that indicates where the song is placed on the file system.
