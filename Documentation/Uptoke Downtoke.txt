The listeners of each channel should have the opportunity to uptoke or downtoke a track - depending on whether they like it or not.
The amount of uptokes/downtokes should affect how often the specific track is played - more uptokes = played more - more downtokes = played less.
Since the tracks are streamed live the listeners should only be able to uptoke/downtoke tracks they have actually listened to, and not before the track is done playing. The user should be presented with the last five songs he/she has listened to and has the option of up-/down-toking the songs.
